The regression process is defined in the following steps:

1.  Define the question(s) of interest in the study
2.  Decide on the response variable, $Y$
3.  Define the covariates, $X_1,...,X_p$
4.  Collect data on both the response variable and the covariates
5.  Specify the model
    *   What form is the model?
    *   What assumptions will we make?
6.  Decide on the method for fitting the specified model
7.  Fit the model (using software)
8.  Examine the fitted model for violations of assumptions
9.  Conduct hypothesis testing for questions of interest
10.  Report the results from statistical inference
